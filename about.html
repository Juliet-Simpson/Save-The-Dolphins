                    <p class="food-text">The Ganges river dolphin (P. gangetica) is one of two endangered species of
                        South Asian River Dolphin, the other being Indus river dolphin which is now found only in the
                        Indus River in Pakistan. In Hindu mythology, the Ganges river dolphin is associated with Ganga,
                        the deity of the Ganges river. The dolphin is said to be one of the creatures which heralded the
                        goddess' descent from the heavens, and Ganga's mount, the Makara, is sometimes depicted as a
                        dolphin. It has been recognised by the government of India as its National Aquatic Animal and is
                        the official animal of the Indian city of Guwahati.</p><p>
                        Both South Asian river dolphins have the long, pointed nose characteristic of all river dolphins
                        and their teeth are visible in both the upper and lower jaws even when the mouth is closed. They
                        are unique among cetaceans in that they swim on their sides. The body is a brownish colour and
                        stocky at the middle. These species have only a small, triangular lump in the place of a dorsal
                        fin. The flippers and tail are thin and large in relation to the body size, which is about 2-2.2
                        meters in males and 2.4–2.6 m in females. The oldest recorded animal was a 28-year-old male, 199
                        cm in length. Mature females are larger than males.</p>
                    <p>
                        Births may take place year round, but appear to be concentrated between December and January and
                        March to May. Females gestate on average once every two years; gestation is thought to be
                        approximately 9–10 months. After around one year, juveniles are weaned and they reach sexual
                        maturity at about 10 years of age.</p>
                    <p> During the monsoon, South Asian river dolphins tend to migrate to tributaries of the main river
                        systems. Occasionally, individuals swim along with their beaks emerging from the water, and they
                        may "breach"; jumping partly or completely clear of the water and landing on their sides.</p>
                    <p>These species feed on a variety of shrimp and fish, including carp and catfish. The Ganges
                        subspecies may take birds and turtles. They are usually encountered on their own or in loose
                        aggregations; the dolphins do not form tight interacting groups. They rely on echolocation to
                        find prey due to their poor eyesight: they lack a crystalline eye lens and have evolved a flat
                        cornea. They are incapable of forming clear images and the dolphin is rendered effectively blind
                        (these species are also referred to as the "blind dolphin"). The muddy waters, or low light
                        conditions, that P. gangetica inhabits negate the use of the little vision that remains.
                        However, the eye may still serve as a light receptor and it still uses its eye to locate itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Ganges subspecies shows object-avoidance behaviour in both the consistently heavily murky
                        waters of its habitat and in clear water in captivity, suggesting it is capable of using
                        echolocation effectively to navigate and forage for prey. It most typically makes echolocation
                        sounds such as clicks, bursts, and twitters.</p>
                    <p>
                        Dolphins can be most commonly found in water with high abundance of prey and reduced flow. They
                        migrate seasonally—downstream in colder conditions with lower water levels and upstream in
                        warmer conditions with higher water levels. Being a mammal, the Ganges river dolphin cannot
                        breathe in the water and must surface every 30–120 seconds. It favours deep pools, eddy
                        counter-currents located downstream of the convergence of rivers and of sharp meanders, and
                        upstream and downstream of midchannel islands.

                    <p class="food-text">Both subspecies of river dolphin are listed by the International Union for
                        Conservation of Nature as endangered on their Red List of Threatened Species. They have been
                        very adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>
                        Development and agriculture have had devastating impacts on their habitats as India undergoes an
                        industrial revolution. The habitat of the Ganges river dolphin is within one of the most densely
                        populated areas of the world and the natural resources in the dolphin habitat are
                        under severe threat from over-exploitation by the communities who live close
                        by as well as due to various developmental projects. Particularly river water for domestic and
                        agricultural use.</p>
                    <p>In most of the areas, the riverbanks are used for agricultural purposes which poses a threat for
                        dolphins. The Ganga is heavily polluted with 9000 tones of pesticides and 6 million
                        tonnes of fertilizers used in the vicinity of the river each year. This is ecologically harmful
                        to the Ganges river dolphin population both directly and indirectly. Pollutants entering into
                        the dolphin habitats are are also lethal to many organisms like zooplanktons, crustaceans,
                        snails and
                        fishes, which are a part of the food chain of dolphins and industrial and agricultural chemicals
                        are biomagnified in the bodies of the dolphins, further contributing to population decline.</p>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers,
                        causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed.
                        An immediate danger for the Ganges subspecies in National Chambal Sanctuary is the decrease in
                        river depth and appearance of sand bars dividing the river course into smaller segments as water
                        level has lowered. Also increased use of water for various
                        development projects has reduced the water quantity as well as quality.</p>
                    <p>
                        Entanglement in fishing nets as bycatch can cause significant damage to local populations, and
                        individuals are taken each year by hunters; their oil and meat are used as a liniment, as an
                        aphrodisiac, and as bait for catfish. In some areas direct exploitation takes place side-byside
                        with degradation of habitats due to human pressures combined
                        with development processes. The Ganges river dolphin is largely distributed
                        where human population growth is also the highest, and environmental
                        conservation is a lower priority as there are other pressing developmental
                        needs.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Ganges river dolphin is important not only because
                        it is endangered, but perhaps more so because it is a reliable indicator of the
                        health of the Ganga, in fact the whole Ganga river ecosystem. It will face extinction in this
                        century unless present
                        trends are reversed.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Indian government is not unaware of the problem and steps are being taken.
                        On the occasion of the 74th Independence Day, 15 August 2020, the Indian Ministry of
                        Environment, Forest and Climate Change announced 'Project Dolphin' to boost conservation of both
                        river and oceanic dolphins.
                        International trade is prohibited by the listing of the South Asian river dolphin on Appendix I
                        of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. It is protected under the Indian
                        Wildlife Act, although these legislations require stricter enforcement.
                        The Ministry of Environment and Forest declared the Gangetic dolphin the national aquatic animal
                        of India and a stretch of the Ganges River between Sultanganj and Kahlgaon in Bihar has been
                        declared a dolphin sanctuary and named Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, the first such
                        protected area.
                        The Uttar Pradesh government in India is propagating ancient Hindu texts in hopes of raising the
                        community support to save the dolphins from disappearing. One of the lines being versed from
                        Valimiki's Ramayan highlights the force by which the Ganges emerged from Lord Shivji's locks
                        and along with this force came many species such as animals, fish, and the Shishumaar—the
                        dolphin.</p>
                    <p>However, more needs to be done, hence this initiative "Save The Gangetic Dolphin".

                        of the Ganga river
                        has been obstructed
                        over the years by
                        the construction

                        or for irrigation.</p>
                    <p> The Ganga basin is one of the most populous regions on Earth.
                        It is home to 450 million people with an average density of over
                        550 individuals per square kilometre. In the delta zone this
                        rises to over 900 per square kilometre. There are some 30 cities,
                        70 towns and thousands
                        of villages along the
                        banks of the Ganga.
                        Nearly all of the sewage
                        from these population
                        centres—over 1.3 billion
                        litres per day—passes
                        directly into the river, along with
                        thousands of animal
                        carcasses, mainly of
                        cattle.</p>
                    <p> A large number of factories/industries like sugar, chemicals, fertilizers, small-scale
                        engineering,
                        pulp, cotton and tanneries are situated on the banks of the river. The
                        discharges from these industries enter the Ganga river directly or indirectly
                        and pollute the river to a considerable extent. An estimated 260 million
                        litres of industrial wastewater, largely untreated, is discharged by hundreds
                        of factories per day.</p>
                    <p> The Ganga river also has religious and mythological significance. All along the
                        Ganga, most of the ghats have religious importance. Pilgrims in large numbers,
                        often in thousands, take a holy bath, cremate their dead and perform other
                        post-cremation activities on
                        the banks of the river and thus
                        contribute to the pollution of
                        the river.</p>
                    <p> Over the past three
                        decades or so, the pollution
                        of the Ganga has reached
                        serious levels leading to local
                        and national campaigns and
                        actions to restore the health of
                        the sacred river.</p>
                    <p> The Ganga supports a rich
                        fauna and flora, including
                        the Ganges
                        river dolphin and
                        at least nine other species of
                        aquatic mammals. Reptiles
                        include three species of
                        crocodiles along with one
                        species of monitor lizard and eleven species of
                        freshwater turtles. The Ganga also has the richest freshwater fish fauna (378
                        species) anywhere in India.
                        The riparian zone supports many plant species that are of both ecological and
                        economic importance. Most plants play an important role in nutrient and
                        water conservation and in controlling soil erosion. They also possess, in many
                        cases, important medicinal properties.</p>
